        "We now want to extend the core deep learning you have learned in the course so far. Deep learning as an applied field is evolving into a number of branches, such as computer vision and NLP. As the number of use cases grows, we will likely see even greater divergence going forward, with each specialization having its own bespoke set of layers that are widely used. If you are interested in pushing the frontiers of this field further, the development of such new layers is of great importance. Here, we'll be discussing another such specialization to help give you an idea of both how deep learning is currently used, but hopefully, even more importantly, how it is that you can extend this framework going forward."

For example, perhaps we would like to forecast the weather for tomorrow, maybe we want to predict the price of a particular stock 5 days from now, or maybe we want to generate a caption for an image. For these tasks, our models need to deal with inputs and outputs that could have *variable* sequence lengths. This is in sharp contrast to the classification and regression tasks we have previously been working on, where the model (i.e. CNN) can only process a single input of fixed dimension and output a single response of fixed dimension. In this homework, we will explore neural network architecures for tasks where both inputs and outputs may be of variable length. In particular, we will study **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**, a powerful deep learning archietcture for sequential and time series data analysis tasks."

When we tune RNN weights, RNN will show different behaviors in terms of how its state evolves as it receives these inputs.

        "So far we have seen only a simple recurrence formula for the Vanilla RNN. In practice, we actually will rarely ever use Vanilla RNN formula. Instead, we will use what we call a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN.  Vanilla RNNs can be tough to train on long sequences due to vanishing and exploding gradients caused by repeated matrix multiplication. LSTMs solve this problem by replacing the simple update rule of the vanilla RNN with a gating mechanism as follows. To learn more about LSTMs are their intuition, we again refer you to [this](https://http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) article.\n",

The learnable parameters of the LSTM are an *input-to-hidden* matrix $W_x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H\\times D}$, a *hidden-to-hidden* matrix $W_h\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H\\times H}$ and a *bias vector* $b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H}$.\n",

We will use these representations to do part-of-speech tagging, which is the act of taking chunks of text and labelling each word in the chunk of text with its corresponding grammatical label (ADJ, NOUN, etc...).

        "Let's start with the most basic representation of words: a set of indicators. We will see that there are deficiencies with this approach, but it will give us some place to bootstrap from. The idea is to find how many unique words there are in our text and then to simply one-hot encode each of the words in the text in a vector of that \"unique words\" size. For example, if we have:\n",

This is similar to how we one-hot encode categorical outputs (such as when we work with MNIST or CIFAR), with the reason being that categorical variables in their integer representations are not living in a smoothly differentiable space. So, we \"embed\" them into the probability vector space, which allows to then use all the machinery of gradient descent as usual.\n",
